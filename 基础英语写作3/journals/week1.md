# Tues. 1st Sep. 

​	Today I reached level 100 in my LOL (League of Legends).

# Thu. 4th Sep.

​	Today I tried a new breakfast combo in Center of the Dining Hall: a bowl of noodles and soybean milk, only 1.1￥!! That's too cheap.

​	The afternoon, another class that the teacher did't give any information about our class (Computer Graphics).

​	The evening, once more... I attended a Junior class (Vocational Counsel).

# Fri. 5th Sep.

​	Today I tried fry fan in Xinhai Dining Room. Woops, I forgot that I cannot eat fan, it nearly made me vomit. What's a bad beginning.

​	Then I spent 2 hours studying Matlab in dormitory. Quite substantial time.

# Tues. 8th Sep.

​	Today, I lost my student card. What's a horrible day. 

# Fri. 11th Sep.

​	Originally, Friday would be a nice day to me. But the new freshmen came today, and we upper class students were asked to help them settle down. Thus messed all my plans up. And what really made me upset was that today was a rainy day. 	After getting wet in the rain, I got cold, and became dizzy and weak at night.

# Sat. 12th Sep.

​	When I woke up, I was like a dying man--- no strength, headache and endless coughs, it felt too bad. But the afternoon, I was asked to greet new comers again. It's the most painful thing I've done this year.

# Sun. 13th Sep.

​	Finally, I had a good rest and almost recovered from cold. Things were gonna turn around.
