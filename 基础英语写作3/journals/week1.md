# Tues. 1st Sep. 

Today I reached level 100 in my LOL (League of Legends).

# Thur. 4th Sep.

​	Today I tried a new breakfast combo in Center of the Dining Hall: a bowl of noodles and soybean milk, only 1.1￥!! That's too cheap.

​	The afternoon, another class that the teacher did't give any information about our class (Computer Graphics).

​	The evening, once more... I attended a Junior class (Vocational Counsel).

# Fri. 5th Sep.

​	Today I tried fry fan in Xinhai Dining Room. Woops, I forgot that I cannot eat fan, it nearly made me vomit. What's a bad beginning.

​	Then I spent 2 hours studying Matlab in dormitary. Quite substantial time.
