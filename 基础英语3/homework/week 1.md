## Similarities and Differences	

​	I think the similarity of high school and college life is to handle things by myself. Because I was a redident student in my high school, so, I was used to the life in school and withouts families around me. And at college, I am just a little far from home, almost all the things are the same as I was in high school. 

​	But there are many different things in my eveyday study. I have too much free time now, and almost cannot control myself to entertain. Though my ideal way to success needs me spend more efforts than others, freedom is too tempting, which let me nearly waste my freshman year.  And the way college classes are taught lets me hard to calm down to study than in high school. Because most of the time, I need to go out the previous classroom to find another. And the intervals between two classes are too short, always, after arriving my next classroom, I have no time to do some things to releasemyself a little. 

## Embarrasing moments	

​	The first time I went to public bathroom, I did not charge my student card in the bath, I thought the card was the same as in my high school, the balance of a card has no branches, and can be spent in all machines. When I stood in front of the  sprinkler, and plugged my card... the three big zeros in the machine shocked me ... I don't want to go, because that through a whole day's military training, I was eager to take a shower to release myself. Luckily, a fellow student went and told me that I need to charge the bath fee in the counter, or I cannot open the sprinkler. I was really embarrassed to made that a stupid mistake. Then the warm-hearted fellow student lent me his card.
