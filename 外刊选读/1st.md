# My writing

1.  I regularly read news articles from Internet, because the Internet is convenient for me to get information from. There are many journalism companies in the Internet, their angles of spoken the facts are different, I can get more useful things from them, and judging from all of them.

2.  My difficulties in reading to English news articles are lengthy articles and unfamilar words. I always forget the previous content of the news when I am reading the long articles. And it is  too hard for me to guess the meanings of a series of strange words.

3.  The top three principles of journalism that I find relevant are timeliness, objectiveness and authenticity. Because what we news comsumers really want to know is the news with these feature.

4.  I think journalism will blossom in the near future, because it shows us ordinary people some important news happend around the world and our nation. And usually, we have no good access to such information except through jounalism.

5.  I would not like to work as a news reporter because I am not quite good at communicating and remembering things, and I would like to get news information from the ready-made articles rather than find by myself.
